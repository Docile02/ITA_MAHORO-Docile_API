The Laravel Bank System is a web-based application that enables users to create and manage accounts, deposit funds, and withdraw money securely. 
To set up the project, ensure you have PHP, Composer, MySQL, and Laravel installed. After cloning the repository, install dependencies, 
configure the environment file, and run database migrations. The frontend uses HTML and CSS, with assets managed via Node.js. 
The API is documented and can be tested using Postman or Swagger. The system includes automated tests and is optimized for deployment in a production environment with proper configurations.
